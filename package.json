  "description": "El Mapa There comes a time when you find yourself dissorientated, you go through a door and forget why you are there, or what you are looking for, you seem to have been neuralyzed. It is for those times that we have developed El Mapa. El Mapa is a web application that runs seamlessly on both mobile and desktop. On load, it  provides you with a map centred on your own location and (dependant on internet speeds) instant access to a mountain of information such as current position on the planet, weather and even the currency of preference so that the next time you go through your front door, you will know everything about what is going on outside.",
